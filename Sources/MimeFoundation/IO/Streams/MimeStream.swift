/// ``MimeStream`` provides the fundamental interface for reading and writing data
/// in a streaming fashion. It supports basic I/O operations including reading,
/// writing, seeking, and flushing.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Streams are used throughout the MIME processing pipeline for handling content
/// data efficiently. Different stream implementations provide various capabilities:
///
/// - ``MemoryStream``: Stores data in memory with full read/write/seek support
/// - ``MemoryBlockStream``: Memory stream optimized to avoid array copying
/// - ``FilteredStream``: Applies transformations as data passes through
/// - ``BoundStream``: Provides a view into a subset of another stream
/// - ``ChainedStream``: Combines multiple streams into one continuous stream
/// - ``MeasuringStream``: Tracks the number of bytes written without storing data
///
/// ## Implementing MimeStream
///
/// When implementing a custom stream, check the capability properties (``canRead``,
/// ``canWrite``, ``canSeek``) before attempting operations. Throw ``StreamError/notSupported``
/// if an unsupported operation is attempted.
public protocol MimeStream: AnyObject {
    /// Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading.
    ///
    /// If a class derived from ``MimeStream`` does not support reading, calls to
    /// ``read(_:offset:count:)`` will throw ``StreamError/notSupported``.
    var canRead: Bool { get }

    /// Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing.
    ///
    /// If a class derived from ``MimeStream`` does not support writing, calls to
    /// ``write(_:offset:count:)`` will throw ``StreamError/notSupported``.
    var canWrite: Bool { get }

    /// Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking.
    ///
    /// If a class derived from ``MimeStream`` does not support seeking, calls to
    /// ``seek(_:origin:)`` will throw ``StreamError/notSupported``.
    var canSeek: Bool { get }

    /// Gets a value indicating whether the current stream can time out.
    ///
    /// The ``canTimeout`` property indicates whether read and write operations
    /// can time out. For streams that do not support timeouts, this returns `false`.
    var canTimeout: Bool { get }

    /// Gets or sets a value, in milliseconds, that determines how long the stream
    /// will attempt to read before timing out.
    ///
    /// A value of 0 indicates that the read operation does not time out.
    /// This property is only meaningful if ``canTimeout`` returns `true`.
    var readTimeout: Int { get set }

    /// Gets or sets a value, in milliseconds, that determines how long the stream
    /// will attempt to write before timing out.

    /// This property is only meaningful if ``canTimeout`` returns `true`.
    var writeTimeout: Int { get set }

    /// Gets or sets the position within the current stream.
    ///
    /// The position is the number of bytes from the beginning of the stream.
    /// Setting the position is equivalent to calling ``seek(_:origin:)``
    /// with ``SeekOrigin/begin``.

    ///   - buffer: An array of bytes. When this method returns, the buffer contains
    ///     the specified byte array with the values between `offset` and
    ///     `(offset + count - 1)` replaced by the bytes read from the current source.
    ///   - offset: The zero-based byte offset in `buffer` at which to begin storing
    ///     the data read from the current stream.
    ///   - count: The maximum number of bytes to be read from the current stream.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The total number of bytes read into the buffer. This can be less than
    ///   the number of bytes requested if that many bytes are not currently available,
    ///   or zero if the end of the stream has been reached.
