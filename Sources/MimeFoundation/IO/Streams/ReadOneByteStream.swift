// Ported from MimeKit (C#) to Swift.
//

/// A stream wrapper that limits read operations to one byte at a time.
///
/// ``ReadOneByteStream`` wraps another ``MimeStream`` and restricts read operations
/// to return at most one byte per call, regardless of the requested count. This is
/// useful for testing stream handling code with minimal read buffers.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// This stream wrapper is primarily used for:
/// - Testing parser robustness with minimal read sizes
/// - Debugging stream processing issues
/// - Simulating slow or constrained I/O conditions
///
/// All other stream operations (write, seek, flush) are passed through unchanged
/// to the underlying stream.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let baseStream = MemoryStream([0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
/// let oneByteStream = ReadOneByteStream(baseStream)
///
/// var buffer = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: 10)
/// let bytesRead = try oneByteStream.read(&buffer, offset: 0, count: 10)
/// // bytesRead will be 1, not 10
/// ```
