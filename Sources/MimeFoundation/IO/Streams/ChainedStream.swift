/// A chained stream that combines multiple streams into one continuous stream.
///
/// ``ChainedStream`` chains multiple streams together such that reading or writing
/// beyond the end of one stream spills over into the next stream in the chain.
/// This makes it appear as if the chain of streams is all one continuous stream.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Chained streams are useful for:
/// - Combining multiple content parts into a single stream
/// - Building composite MIME messages from separate parts
/// - Reading from multiple data sources as if they were one
///
/// ## Capabilities
///
/// The ``ChainedStream`` only supports a capability (read, write, seek) if ALL of its
/// child streams support that capability. An empty ``ChainedStream`` reports that it
/// cannot read, write, or seek.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let chain = ChainedStream()
/// try chain.add(headerStream)
/// try chain.add(boundaryStream)
/// try chain.add(contentStream, leaveOpen: true)
///
/// // Read from the combined stream
/// var buffer = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: 1024)
/// while true {
///     let bytesRead = try chain.read(&buffer, offset: 0, count: buffer.count)
///     if bytesRead == 0 { break }
///     // Process buffer...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// ``ChainedStream`` is not thread-safe. External synchronization is required
/// when accessing a chained stream from multiple threads.
